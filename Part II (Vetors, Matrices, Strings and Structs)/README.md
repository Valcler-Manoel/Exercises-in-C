## Exercises

1. **Array Display in Staircase Pattern:**  
   A program that initializes an integer array with 5 elements (values from 1 to 5) and displays them in a "staircase" or diagonal pattern, one per line.

2. **Array Analysis (Max, Min, Sum, Average):**  
   A program that reads an array of 10 non-negative integers, then displays the maximum, minimum, sum, and average of the values. It also prints the values in reverse order, separated by commas. The program ensures that only non-negative values are accepted.

3. **Matrix Input and Display:**  
   A program that reads two integers representing the number of rows (`l`) and columns (`c`) of a matrix. It then creates a matrix of size `l x c`, reads the elements, and displays the matrix in tabular form.

4. **Matrix Multiplication (Double Precision):**  
   Based on the previous matrix example, this program reads the dimensions `l` and `c` for two matrices: one of size `l x c` and the other of size `c x l`. It reads the elements for both matrices and computes their multiplication, displaying the result.

5. **Determinant of a Square Matrix:**  
   A program that reads a positive integer `n`, representing the size of a square matrix `n x n`, and calculates the determinant of the matrix.

6. **Prime Number Check in Matrix:**  
   A program that reads a 5x5 matrix of integers and checks if all the elements are prime numbers, displaying the result.

7. **Palindrome Check:**  
   A program that reads a string (up to 100 characters) and checks if it is a palindrome, i.e., if the sequence of characters is the same forwards and backwards (examples: "ovo", "arara", "rever", "ana", etc.).

8. **Student Structure:**  
   A program that defines a structure for a student, which includes their enrollment number, name, three test scores, and the average of these scores. It reads data into the structure, calculates the average, and displays the size of the structure in bytes.

9. **Personal Data Structure (Cadastro):**  
   A program that defines a new data type (`cadastro`) to represent personal data, including full name, phone number, and address. It prompts the user for a positive integer `N` (between 1 and 5) and creates an array of `N` `cadastro` elements. The program then reads data for `N` people and prints the information.

10. **Coordinate Structure and Distance Calculation:**  
    A program that defines a structure to represent the coordinates of a point (X, Y). It then reads the coordinates of a point and calculates and displays the distance from the point to the origin (0, 0).
