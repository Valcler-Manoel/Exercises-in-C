## About This Repository

This repository contains various C programming exercises developed as part of my studies. The main objective is to practice and explore core concepts in programming such as arrays, matrices, recursion, structures, and memory management. Each program represents a different problem or challenge, focused on building knowledge and problem-solving skills.
